# FourierRepresentation
Fourier Series representation for each harmonic in complex domain.

x axis of the plot is the real component of harmonics, while y axis is imaginary.
By changing the number of harmonic, type of increment of the frequency, you can generate different type of fourier serries.
You can also plot real or imaginary part of the summation of the harmonics, which will give you the time domain sum of harmonics.
With the time domain plots you can generate square wave triangulare wave etc.
